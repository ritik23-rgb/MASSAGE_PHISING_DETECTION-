# MASSAGE_PHISING_DETECTION-

# CyberSentinel - Phishing Detection Tool

## Overview
**CyberSentinel** is a powerful phishing detection tool designed to help users analyze suspicious messages, links, or content for potential threats. With an easy-to-use interface, it scans messages for phishing keywords, provides feedback, and stores a history of past scans. It leverages machine learning models for real-time phishing detection.

## Features
- **Message Analysis**: Paste a suspicious message to detect phishing.
- **Phishing Keyword Highlighting**: Keywords like "urgent", "click here", "verify", etc., are highlighted.
- **Scan History**: Stores all previous scans in local storage for easy reference.
- **Feedback**: Users can provide feedback on the result to improve accuracy.
- **Premium Features**: Advanced threat analysis, contextual scanning, cloud history storage, and real-time scam alerts.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 16.x or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

### Steps to Run the Application

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/CyberSentinel.git
Install Dependencies Navigate to the project folder and install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd CyberSentinel
npm install
Run the Application After installing dependencies, you can run the application:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm start
This will start the React development server and open the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

Backend Setup The tool requires a backend API to perform the analysis. Set up a backend server (e.g., Flask) to handle message analysis and feedback. You can refer to the backend instructions below.

Backend Instructions
Clone the Backend Repository (or your backend folder): You will need a backend to handle the analysis request and provide the status (safe, suspicious, or malicious) based on the message.

Install Python and Dependencies Install Python (version 3.x or higher) and the necessary libraries (Flask, etc.):

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install flask
pip install some-phishing-detection-library
Run the Flask Server Ensure your Flask backend is running on http://127.0.0.1:5000 (or update the frontend URL accordingly).

Technologies Used
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Axios: Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.

HTML/CSS: Structure and styling of the web application.

Flask: Backend framework to handle phishing message analysis.

Machine Learning (Optional): To detect phishing messages based on trained models.

Future Features
Integrate advanced machine learning models to detect phishing more accurately.

Provide a report export feature (e.g., PDF, CSV).

Add multi-language support.

Real-time push notifications for new phishing attempts.
